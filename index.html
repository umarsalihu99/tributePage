                <p>
                    We have four enemies: the world, shaytaan, the ego and passionate desire. Each of them has a weapon and has a prison. The world is an enemy and its weapon is meeting with people. Its prison is seclusion. The ego is an enemy and its weapon is satiating
                    ones appetite. It's prison is hunger. Shaytaan is an enemy and his weapon is speech. His prison is silence. And passionate desire's weapon is sleep and its prison is staying awake. Seclusion, hunger, silence, and staying awake are
                    the characteristics of the abdal. The point is that nothing will cause the ego to behave except hunger.

            <h4>Timeline</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>8th November, 1900</strong> - Born in the village of Tayba Ñaseen between the Senegalese city of Kaolack and the border of Gambia</li>
                <li><strong>1922</strong> - After his father's (Allaaji Abdulaay Ñas) death in Lewna Ñaseen in 1922, Shaykh Ibrāhīm's elder brother, Muhammad al-Khalīfa, became his father's successor or Khalīfa.</li>
                <li><strong>1929</strong> - While on the farm in Kóosi Mbittéyeen, the youthful Shaykh Ibrāhīm announced that he had been given the Key to Secrets of Divine Knowledge, and thus became the Khalifa of Sheykh Tijani in the Tijaniyya Order, a
                    position yet to be attained by anyone as of that time.</li>
                <li><strong>1930</strong> - In 1930, Shaykh Ibrahim decide to relocate with his disciples to a new place. In the evening, he set out with a small group of his closest disciples to find a new place to live, and the next day they established
                    a new zāwiya in Medina Baay, a village that was later incorporated into the growing city of Kaolack
                </li>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - In 1937 upon meeting Shaykh Ibrahim during a pilgrimage to Makkah, the Emir of Kano, Nigeria, Alhaji 'Abdullahi Bayero gave his oath of allegiance to the shaykh and declared himself a disciple of shaykh Ibrahim.
                    That incident made Shaykh Ibrahim gain the allegiance of many of the prominent Tijānī leaders of Northern Nigeria and also many others who were not Tijani prior to this time.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - During the summer of 1945 he reestablished himself in his father's house in his natal village of Tayba Ñaseen, rebuilding and reorganizing the village after a fire outbreak had destroyed much of it.</li>
                <li><strong>26th July, 1975</strong> - Sheikh Ibrahim Inyass passed away in 1975 at St Thomas' Hospital in London, England.</li>
